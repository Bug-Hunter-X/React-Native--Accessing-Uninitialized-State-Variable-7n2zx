This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: accessing an uninitialized state variable.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, attempting to render the state before it's fully initialized.  The solution, `bugSolution.js`, uses the optional chaining operator and a conditional check to gracefully handle this situation.  This prevents crashes and improves the application's robustness.
